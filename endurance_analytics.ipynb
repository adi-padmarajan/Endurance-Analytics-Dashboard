    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes **347 running activities over 3.5 years**, documenting the progression from a first-time marathoner (4:46:07 at Royal Victoria Marathon 2022) to a sub-3:30 finisher (3:26:00 at Royal Victoria Marathon 2025) — an improvement of **80 minutes** across 6 marathon races.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis explores how training patterns, physiological adaptations, and race execution evolved to produce consistent performance gains at two recurring races: the **Royal Victoria Marathon** (4 finishes) and **BMO Vancouver Marathon** (2 finishes).\n",

    "## Planned Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Marathon Progression Timeline\n",
    "A bar or line chart displaying finish times across all 6 marathons, highlighting the downward trend from 4:46 to 3:26. This serves as the anchor visualization for the entire analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pace Evolution Curve\n",
    "Line chart tracking average pace (min/km) for each marathon with a trend line, demonstrating the progression from 6:30/km to 4:50/km.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Heart Rate Efficiency Analysis\n",
    "Scatterplot comparing pace vs. average heart rate across marathons. This visualization reveals aerobic efficiency gains — running faster at similar cardiac output indicates improved fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Training Volume by Marathon Block\n",
    "Stacked area or bar chart showing weekly mileage in the 12–16 weeks preceding each marathon. Correlates training load with race-day performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Monthly Running Volume Heatmap\n",
    "Calendar-style heatmap (similar to GitHub contributions) showing daily/weekly running activity, revealing consistency patterns and training periodization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Long Run Progression\n",
    "Tracks the longest training runs before each marathon, showing how peak long run distance evolved across training cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Course Comparison: Victoria vs Vancouver\n",
    "Side-by-side comparison of the two race courses, analyzing elevation profiles, pace distribution, and heart rate response to control for course difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Cumulative Distance Over Time\n",
    "Running total of kilometers logged since February 2022, with marathon race days marked as milestones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Elevation vs Pace Relationship\n",
    "Scatterplot examining how elevation gain impacts average pace across all training runs, useful for understanding performance on hilly courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Challenge Engagement Timeline\n",
    "Bar chart or heatmap showing monthly Strava challenge completions, illustrating engagement and motivation patterns throughout the training journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions This Analysis Will Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What training volume correlates with marathon performance?**  \n",
    "   Is there a weekly mileage threshold that predicts sub-4:00 or sub-3:30 performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How did aerobic efficiency improve?**  \n",
    "   Can we quantify the pace/HR relationship improvement over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What distinguishes Victoria vs Vancouver performances?**  \n",
    "   Are course-specific factors (elevation, weather) affecting results?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What does the optimal taper look like?**  \n",
    "   How did training volume change in the final 2–3 weeks before each race?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Is there a long run distance that predicts race success?**  \n",
    "   What was the longest run before each PR?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance** is measured in kilometers\n",
    "- **Speed** is measured in meters per second (converted to min/km pace for analysis)\n",
    "- **Time** values are in seconds\n",
    "- **Heart Rate** data is unavailable for the first 20 runs (Feb–Jun 2022) due to no HR monitor\n",
    "- **Elevation** is measured in meters\n",
